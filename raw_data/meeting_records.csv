      ""description"": ""• What we'll do\nThis Meetup is being organised by Alyona from the 'Natural Language Processing in NZ' meetup.\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Natural-Language-Processing-in-NZ/events/247943232/\n\nWe are super excited to bring you a 3h hands-on workshop on a key task in NLP: Sentiment Analysis.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Spaces are strictly limited, so please only RSVP if you are guaranteed to set aside your full Monday afternoon for this. Also please only RSVP under one of the meetup groups.\n\nSentiment analysis is the task of automatically classifying text into sentiment categories such as positive and negative. Until 2014, state-of-the-art solutions to this problem relied on shallow learning schemes based on hand-crafted features and linear machine learning models. Deep neural networks architectures had became very popular in the computer vision community due to its success for detecting objects (“cat”,“bicycles”) regardless of its position in the image. These approaches have also been recently adopted for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis, with successful results. In this tutorial, we use sentiment analysis as a case study for introducing modern neural network architectures for NLP, including word embeddings, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. We won't go extremely deep with the math but will explain how these black boxes (e.g., embeddings, LSTMs,) work. People expecting live coding demos won't get disappointed. No previous linguistic knowledge is required. Basic understanding of mathematical concepts such as functions, matrices, and derivatives may be helpful but is not essential.

Since I'm visiting Auckland again, I thought it might be cool to catch up and I could repeat this talk:\n\n\""Alyona Medelyan will be sharing her story of discovering NLP while studying linguistics and pivoting her degree into CS and Machine Learning. She will explain the ML framework of the keyword extraction algorithm KEA, powered by one of the first ML libraries WEKA. Having co-authored the most-cited study of using Wikipedia in NLP research, she'll share two of her own projects that use it, including Maui, which ended up getting onto the radar of NATO.\n\nAlyona's passion lies in commercialization of research ideas. On her third attempt she managed to start a company that uses the ideas from her PhD to solve a problem most companies struggle with today: understanding the needs of their customers. She will share how she co-founded Thematic and the what was required to turn it into a successful venture.\"""",

They are large complex molecules, made up of chains of amino acids, and what a protein does largely depends on its unique 3D structure. Figuring out what shapes proteins fold into is known as the “protein folding problem”, and has stood as a grand challenge in biology for the past 50 years. In a major scientific advance, the latest version of our AI system AlphaFold has been recognised as a solution to this grand challenge by the organisers of the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP). This breakthrough demonstrates the impact AI can have on scientific discovery and its potential to dramatically accelerate progress in some of the most fundamental fields that explain and shape our world.\""\n\nThis week we will be reviewing and discussing the massive scientific breakthrough that was made using Machine Learning.

      ""description"": ""This week we will be discussing the Porto Seguro Kaggle Competition at a high level and will discuss team formation.\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction\n\nPlease look at the competition and attempt it before coming to the meetup. The real value from this group comes from when people give the competition some effort and can come to the meetup with their ideas and questions that came up for them.\n\nTony has provided instructions below * for how to get started using R if you are new to Kaggle. The purpose of this meetup is to attempt the competition and use the discussion time to comment, share ideas and ask questions.\n\nThis week we encourage you to bring the results of your model to the meetup so that we can share them and each take them away to ensemble for a group submission. See instructions for this below ** You must follow these instructions closely for this to work.\n\nNote: In order to comply with the Kaggle rules we will not be sharing any executable code unless it is also shared publicly on the Kaggle website.\n\nMeeting Schedule:\n\n6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue\n\n6:30 - Introductions\n\n6:35 - Discussion - Porto Seguro Kaggle competition\n\n7:30 - Decide on what to talk about at next meeting\n\n7:40 - Meeting ends\n\nThank you to GridAKL for providing the venue!\n\n* Here are the instructions to install R:\n\nDownload R from https://mran.microsoft.com/download/ and install it\nDownload the free RStudio Desktop https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and install it\nRun Rstudio\nInside RStudio open the R kernel that you downloaded from Kaggle and make sure the kernel is accessing the right location for the train.csv and test.csv you downloaded from Kaggle\nRun the kernel and send the submission file that it created to Kaggle\n\n** Instructions for joining the team to ensemble\n\n1) There are 595212 rows of training data. Split these rows into a training set and a holdout set using id > 1338765 as the holdout\nset. This will produce a training set of 535691 rows and a holdout set of 59521 rows. Put the holdout set aside. Don't use it for\nanything related to your model. Don't use it for feature engineering or validation or ANYTHING.\n\n2) Fit your model using the 535691 rows of the training set.\n\n3) Use the model from (2) to predict the 59521 rows of the holdout set. Save the probabilities into a two column csv file with\nheaders id,target and name the file yourname.yourmodel.yourscore.holdout.csv\n\n4) combine the training data and holdout data into the original 595212 rows of training data\n\n5) repeat step (2) with this new training data - use the same method to fit as in (2) to make sure that the model is the same as (2)\nbut with the benefit of the extra data\n\n6) Use the model from (5) to predict the 892816 rows of the Kaggle test set. Save the probabilities into a two column csv file with\nheaders id,target and name the file yourname.yourmodel.yourscore.test.csv\n\n7) Submit that csv file to Kaggle and record the score\n\n8) Bring both csv files and the score along to the next meeting and also put them in the Dropbox repository https://www.dropbox.com/request/Y97jOmZpK4sJMuIjVJEZ and be prepared to\nsay a few sentences about what you did\n\nAll models are useful even if they score low. \""Weak learners\"" can be built into strong learners. So don't worry about your score.\n\nBring along more models if you want - but try to bring at least one."",

Lei has industry experience with companies doing very impressive things in China and has some great insight into applying machine learning.\n\nAlso, we will have a regular discussion format with a wrap up on the porto seguro competition ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction ). Now that this competition has finished it is a great time to look at some of the winning solutions and learn what the most successful approaches are. Before you come to the meet-up, try to spend some time looking at the competition and one or two of the kernels. Also if you want to keep learning, although the competition is closed you may make late submissions.\n\nMeeting Schedule:\n\n6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue\n\n6:30 - Introductions\n\n6:35 - Discussion - Porto Seguro Kaggle competition / presentation from Lei\n\n7:30 - Meeting ends\n\nA big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!"",
