### Correlation Does Not Imply Causation
11 February 2021

Causal Inference:

Last meetup we looked at the most important ideas of the last 50 years. Of which, causation was the one most often bought up during the discussion. This week we will be diving deeper into this topic.

Our reading and viewing list is this:
- introductory blog post - https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/causal-inference-an-introduction-f424df7c76ef
- Causal Inference lecture (From MIT's ML for Healthcare series) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkUhg9Wb-I

From this material:
- What did you learn?
- What did you not understand?
- What did you think was interesting?

Please try to read the material before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you do not understand it all, the purpose of the meetup is to learn and ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
