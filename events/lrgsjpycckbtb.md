### DRL to win at Poker and Games of Imperfect Information
15 July 2021

"Many real-world applications can be described as large-scale games of imperfect information"

This week we continue our recent trend of looking at Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We will look at a paper that uses self-play with DRL to learn to effectively play the game of poker.

As always we encourage you to read the material before coming to the meetup. It is fine if you cant understand parts of the it or cannot finish it. The purpose of this meetup is to spend some time with the material beforehand so that you can comment about what you thought and ask questions around where you got stuck. We are all here to learn.

One last thing, at the end of the session we have topic proposals, then we vote to decide on the topic for the next meetup. If you would like to propose a research paper, blog post, Kaggle competition or something else, prepare 30 seconds to a minute to give the proposal.

We hope to see you there!

6:30 - Introductions
