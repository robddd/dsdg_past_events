Please join us for the first meeting of 2017 where we will be discussing the Kaggle Competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced

The idea of the discussion is that everyone takes a look at the competition, maybe reads the forums and attempt the competition, then we meet to discuss. How much time you spend looking at the competition before the meeting is upto you. We will share what we have learnt and questions of things we are unsure of. Everyone will be given a chance to share if they like.

Big thanks to GridAKL for supplying the venue. I am pleased to say the RSVP is higher this time. Discussion will be in the tech cafe space.
