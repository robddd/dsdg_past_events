## The Current State of Deep Learning - Reading Group
### 4 June 2020
RSVPs: 40 | Waiting: 5 | Event Type: online | [Meetup Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/269969161)

Deep Learning is continuing to make rapid progress. With no limit in sight, we thought now would be a great time to hold a reading group on the current state of the technology. We will be focusing on the research paper "A Survey of Deep Learning for Scientific Discovery" [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11755.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11755.pdf)

This paper contains overviews of all the current Deep Learning techniques used across a wide variety of applications. Diving into it is the perfect chance to brush up on any gaps in your knowledge.

Please do try to read the material before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you do not understand it all and maybe a good idea just to pick 2 or 3 of the sections of the paper that you are interested in to read, since it is quite a long paper.

The purpose of this meetup to learn and to ask questions. We will start with a round of brief introductions followed by a group discussion where everyone will have a turn to share what they thought about the paper and ask any questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Info for how to join online conference will be emailed out to those who RSVP a day or two before the event
