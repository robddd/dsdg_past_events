Escape the madness of Christmas and come on down to our last meet up for the year!

This time we will have a short presentation from Lei who will be sharing his experiences with gradient boosting methods. Lei has industry experience with companies doing very impressive things in China and has some great insight into applying machine learning.

Also, we will have a regular discussion format with a wrap up on the porto seguro competition ( https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction ). Now that this competition has finished it is a great time to look at some of the winning solutions and learn what the most successful approaches are. Before you come to the meet-up, try to spend some time looking at the competition and one or two of the kernels. Also if you want to keep learning, although the competition is closed you may make late submissions.
