### 10 September 2020
RSVPs: 30 | Waiting: 3 | Event Type: online | [Meetup Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/271933153)

This week we are focussing on what to do when we have missing data. And also the "Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines" competition: [https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/) (Which has a lot of missing data).

The group is designed around participants doing some experimentation or reading before the group. Then, at the group, everyone will get a chance to share what they have done and to ask questions about things that they are wondering about.

We will leave it up to you in terms of any research papers or articles that you would like to read, or any experiments that you would like to run. Although we encourage you to experiment with the Flu competition (linked above) as it has a range of features with missing values.

It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end.

Zoom link will be sent out by email on the day of the event.
