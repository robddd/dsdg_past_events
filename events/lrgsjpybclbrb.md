### Predict Flu Vaccinations
13 August 2020

With members of the group at the top of the leaderboard, and a great approachable competition for trying those techniques we've always wondered about we are going to continue on with this competition.

This is a great chance to try any technique that you want to and then come to the group to discuss and ask questions, all that we ask is that you get your hands dirty and try the techniques on this competition.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end
