A suggestion from last week's group was that we stay with the NLP theme but look for something practical. This week, we will look to apply our new knowledge to the current Kaggle Competition "Tweet Sentiment Extraction" - https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction

The meetup will begin with a short introduction to the competition, followed by our usual discussion format.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leader board. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end.

This meetup will be held online via video conference. Information about connecting to the meeting will be sent out closer to the time.
