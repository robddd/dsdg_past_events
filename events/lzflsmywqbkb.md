This week is a change from our regular meetup agenda.

One of our regular members, Kim, has started a meetup (R-Ladies Auckland - [https://www.meetup.com/rladies-auckland/](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-auckland/) ) and she has arranged to have Hadley Wickham present 'An Introduction to the Tidyverse'. Hadley Wickham has contributed several popular and widely used open source packages for R collectively known as the "tidyverse".

You may RSVP here or on the R-Ladies event. Here is the link to this event posted on R-Ladies Auckland:
