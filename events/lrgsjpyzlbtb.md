Imagine standing at the check-out counter at the grocery store with a long line behind you and the cashier not-so-quietly announces that your card has been declined. In this moment, you probably arenï¿½t thinking about the data science that determined your fate.

After a lot of interest in the competition last week, we return to look at the Kaggle IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Competition [https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection)

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue

6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
