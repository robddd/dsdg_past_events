Here are some links to get started:

[https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM)

[https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

We encourage you to install the package and have a go at using it so that you can share your experience.

If you find any other documentation or materials related to LightGBM that you find useful, please share them in the comments.

Also, following on from some of the discussion at the last meetup, Dana will be sharing her method for reading papers that are heavy on mathematical equations.

There is a new competition on Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction) - we encourage you to take a look before coming and we'll discuss the idea of competing as a team.
