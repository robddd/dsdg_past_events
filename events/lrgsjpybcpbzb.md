### Mechanisms of Action Prediction
19 November 2020

With the contest deadline falling a few days after this meeting, this will be our last chance to look at the competition while it is live. This competition is a great chance to practice: using Neural Networks for tabular data, using Pytorch and/or Tensorflow, training on the Kaggle GPU kernels, multi-label data, stacking, and a lot more! So, set some time aside and take a look at the Kaggle competition: Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa

Looking for ideas or inspiration? Here is a great post with links for novel ideas of how to approach this problem https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/183377

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leader-board. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
