## Feature Engineering for Machine Learning
### 7 November 2019
RSVPs: 45 | Waiting: 0 | Event Type: physical | [Meetup Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/265385162)

Note: Originally we were to discuss this topic on October 24th, but we postponed due to effects of the fire in Auckland CBD.

Arguably the most important part of Machine Learning is feature engineering. This week we will meet to discuss this interesting and nuanced topic.

We will leave it to you to decide what material you would like to look at before the meeting, Alan has provided some suggestions below of some papers and links that you may find interesting.

Also, if you would like to share any examples of creative feature engineering you have seen or done in the past in any Kaggle Competition or Machine Learning Project, that would be great!

Please do some preparation before coming to the meet up. If you are looking at a paper, It is fine if you do not understand it all. The purpose of this meetup to ask any questions about where you are unsure so that we can all learn.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
