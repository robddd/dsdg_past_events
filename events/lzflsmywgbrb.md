Kaggle - House Price Regression competition

https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Please come and discuss with us the kaggle house price regression competition (link above). We ask that you have a look at the competition and attempt to get as far as you can with it. If you only have a little experience, this may be be as simple as trying to install python or importing the data set. But if you have the time and experience please try and make a submission.

This meetup is designed learning through sharing experiences and asking questions about the things that came up as they were attempting the competition.

Also, those that make submissions, bring your best submission .csv file and we will ensemble them and submit to see what we score.

And please cancel your RSVP if you are not going to be able make it.

We are back in the GridAKL cafe space for this meetup. Thanks to GridAKL for hosting us!
