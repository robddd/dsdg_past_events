XGBoost is one of the most effective machine learning algorithms. It has been behind the winning entry of many kaggle competitions. For this meetup we will be discussing a paper titled "XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System" available here:

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02754.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02754.pdf)

Please try to read the paper before the meetup. It is fine if you do not understand all of it. The purpose of this meetup is for questions and discussion and to help each other learn. Some of the topics may be quite advanced in this meetup but we encourage members of all levels to attend.

We are back in the GridAKL cafe space for this meetup. Thanks to GridAKL for hosting us
