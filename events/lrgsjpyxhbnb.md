### Data Science & Machine Learning Discussion Group
10 May 2018

This week we are back with another Kaggle competition: Avito Demand Prediction Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction This competition has it all, image classification, text classification and more.

We will also give people the chance to discuss the Talking Data fraud detection challenge from last week, which will have just finished https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end
