### Reward Maximisation to Solve AGI?
1 July 2021

This week, we continue our exploration of Reinforcement Learning with an examination of a new paper from some heavy hitters in the field. We will look at the paper �Reward is Enough� by Silver, Singh, Precup and Sutton. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370221000862

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is rapidly growing in popularity as an alternative to supervised and unsupervised learning. This paper offers a hypothesis for how far RL may be able to drive the quest for Artificial General Intelligence.

As always we encourage you to read the material before coming to the meetup. It is fine if you cant understand parts of the it or cannot finish it. The purpose of this meetup is to spend some time with the material beforehand so that you can comment about what you thought and ask questions around where you got stuck. We are all here to learn.

ALSO, If there is a paper you would like to nominate to discuss for the next meetup, please prepare a 30-60 second introduction to the paper so we can vote to decide the next topic.

We hope to see you there!

Meeting Schedule:

6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Nominations and vote for next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends
