### Elo Merchant Category Recommendation - Kaggle competition
17 January 2019

This meetup we will be looking at the Elo Merchant Category Recommendation Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation With Christmas and New Year holidays, what a great chance to get some time away from the abundance of family members and brush up those data science skills

This competition presents some great opportunities to to try to deeply understand the problem and add your own creativity.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end
