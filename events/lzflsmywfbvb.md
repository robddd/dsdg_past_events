### 16 March 2017
RSVPs: 36 | Waiting: 0 | Event Type: physical | [Meetup Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/238174855)

Please join us to discuss the Kaggle Competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques as well as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

The idea of the discussion is that everyone takes a look at the competition, maybe reads the forums and attempts the competition. then we meet to discuss. How much time you spend looking at the competition before the meeting is upto you. We will share what we have learnt and questions of things we are unsure of. Everyone will be given a chance to share if they like. The level of discussion will be aimed around that of people who have attempted the competition, but all levels of experience are welcome and people new to data science and machine learning will still be able to learn a lot from the discussion.

Big thanks to GridAKL for supplying the venue. We will be in their tech cafe space
