where they have made their implementation and documentation available.

Please attempt to read the paper or use the package before the meetup. We will go around the room, sharing our thoughts and experiences and asking questions about anything we can't understand or anywhere we got stuck. The purpose of this meetup is for questions and discussion and to help each other learn.

The topics in this meetup are likely to be quite advanced, however we encourage members of all levels to attend.

Following the discussion of the paper, we will have a presentation by Don Johnston - Don has been working on his ideas around seasonal forecasting and will be sharing them with the group.

Finally, have a think about any ideas or presentations for the next meetup. If you have submitted on a now closed competition and would like to share your work with the group please let us know. Also if there are any particular topics and you can suggest an article, academic paper or chapter from a book that we may talk about please let us know. We will discuss at the end of the meeting.

Meeting Schedule:

6:30 - Discussion of paper

7:20 - Seasonal Forecasting presentation by Don Johnston

7:35 - Discussion on topics for next meeting

7:40 - Meeting ends
