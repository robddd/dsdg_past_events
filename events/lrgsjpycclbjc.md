NOTE: THIS WEEK WE WILL BE ON ZOOM AS WE ARE IN THE LOCKDOWN.
An email will be sent to all who have RSVP'd an hour before the meeting is due to start.

This week we are returning to our roots and looking at a Kaggle Competition. This competition covers many areas that come up during our discussions, including:
* Structured Data
* Time Series
* Financial Markets
* Feature Engineering
* Using Deep Learning for Tablular Data

The competition is �Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction� https://www.kaggle.com/c/optiver-realized-volatility-prediction/overview/description It offers us a great chance to get our hands dirty attempting to make predictions, then come together as a group, share what we did, where we got stuck and brainstorm for ideas to try next.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meetup. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you tried, ask questions and to learn.

If you would like to propose a research paper, blog post, Kaggle competition or something else as the topic for the following meeting, prepare a 30-60 second proposal. We will have these proposals at the end of the session.

We hope to see you there!
