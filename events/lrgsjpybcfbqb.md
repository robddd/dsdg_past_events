With a bit of a mixup last week, we were unable to have the meeting. Since there has been a lot of interest from our members, we decided to continue this topic for this meetup. Come along and get an insight into the future of machine intelligence!

We have all seen Machine Learning models using vast quantities of data to beat human level performance at narrowly defined specific tasks. But what about algorithms that generalise to many tasks and recognise patterns given only a few examples?

This week we are looking at the Kaggle - Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge (ARC): https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/overview

A good place to start is by looking at the data and working out how you solve the puzzles yourself, you can see the data visualised here: https://www.kaggle.com/tayyabali55/explored-the-complete-abstraction-data-train-test

And for a good complete explanation of the challenge and the dataset, this paper by the creator of the challenge is an important read https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01547.pdf

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
