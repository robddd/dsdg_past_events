### Mechanisms of Action Prediction (ONLINE)
24 September 2020

Tabular datasets are our bread and butter, we eagerly check our emails multiple times per day, hoping that Kaggle are going to announce a new competition with a tabular dataset. Sadly, these emails are becoming further and further apart. Although, last week, one such email arrived.

This week we are looking at the Kaggle competition: Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa Similar to the "Flu" competition we have been looking at, this competition has multiple labels to predict, so allows us to continue looked into stacking models.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leader-board. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Please note, we intend to have this meetup online but may move to our regular venue depending on the Alert level. If this is the case an email will be sent out and this description will be updated. If online proceeds, connection information will be sent out by email through meetup to those who have RSVP'd.
