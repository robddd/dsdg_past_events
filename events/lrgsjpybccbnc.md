### First Meetup for 2020!
30 January 2020

For the first meetup of the year we would like to discuss the current state of the group and ideas for future meetups. This is your chance to share your thoughts and contribute to the direction of the group for 2020.

We have sent out a survey to get members feedback on the group. We will present the results of this feedback and then share ideas and discuss what topics and competitions we can focus on in future meetups.

If you haven't already, could you please respond to the short survey here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVlWQiDmbQTOCH49NlpUy_Bl06GhdCoFT29kjlJGeAqWccXQ/viewform
