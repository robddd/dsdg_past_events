This week we will be recapping the recently finished Abstraction and Reasoning competition. The session will commence with a presentation from Julie who finished inside the top 50, earning a silver medal. Julie will speak about her solution to the problem and also about what the winners of the competition did.

Then we will have our regular discussion format, where we will talk about the competition and the winning solutions. Some links to look at before the session:
