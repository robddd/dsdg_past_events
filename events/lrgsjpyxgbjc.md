After a couple of weeks getting deep into the world of deep learning research papers we are mixing things up and looking at a Kaggle competition.

This week we will look at https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection

As always we encourage you all to attempt the the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end
