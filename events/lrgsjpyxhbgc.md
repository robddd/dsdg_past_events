This week we are doing something a little different we will continue to talk about the Avito Demand Prediction Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction) but also offer the option of discussing research papers relating to NLP, Image recognition and tabular data. All of which are elements of this competition.
- NLP Paper - A Neural Probabilistic Language Model - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf
- Image recognition paper - Deep residual networks for image recognition - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition and/or look at a research paper before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end
