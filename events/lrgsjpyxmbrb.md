Is AutoML going to live up to the hype? Or is it just an over-hyped hyper-parameter search?

AutoML is a topic which has been brought up more and more during these discussions. At the last meeting we voted and decided that it was time to dedicate an entire meeting to it.

Here are some places to get started:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03268

Google AutoML https://cloud.google.com/automl/
AutoKeras https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras
TensorFlow https://github.com/melodyguan/enas
Pytourch https://github.com/carpedm20/ENAS-pytorch

We encourage you to do some preparation by reading some of these articles or other sources before the meet up. It is fine if you don't understand all of this topic. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
