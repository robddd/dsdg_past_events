### Predict Flu Vaccinations
16 July 2020

After several weeks of diving into research papers, this meetup we are going back to our roots of Machine Learning problems. We are going to look at the "Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines" competition. https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/

This competition looks like it is fairly straight forward with a relatively small amount of features and binary classes. A great chance to try out some of those techniques you have been thinking about putting into action. It is also a multi-label classification problem which adds some interesting opportunities.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meetup. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you tried, ask questions and to learn.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:
