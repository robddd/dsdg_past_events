### Graph Neural Networks
13 February 2020

Thanks to everyone who filled out our survey and came to the meetup last week. At the meetup we took a vote at the for the next topic and the winner was "Graph Neural Networks". They're so hot right now! What are they? How do they work? How are they trained? How useful are they? So many question�

� and we want answers. So this week, Graph Neural Networks will be our focus.

Please spend some time preparing for the meetup. It is fine if you do not understand some of the material. The purpose of this meetup to ask questions where you are unsure so that we can all learn.

Suggested Material (there is a lot here, maybe try and just look at 1 or 2):

Introductory Level:
- If you are new to graph theory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory
- Graph Theory Introductory Video (Very clear and easy to understand explanations): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQA-m22wjTQ&list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P
- Intro to graph algorithms: https://towardsdatascience.com/data-scientists-the-five-graph-algorithms-that-you-should-know-30f454fa5513

Graph Neural Networks:
- Gentle introduction: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-graph-neural-network-basics-deepwalk-and-graphsage-db5d540d50b3
- Video: Graph representation learning (Stanford lecture) https://towardsdatascience.com/data-scientists-the-five-graph-algorithms-that-you-should-know-30f454fa5513
- Paper: Comprehensive study of Graph Neural Networks: https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00596
- Paper: Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261

Get your hands dirty:
- TensorFlow: https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets
- PyTorch: https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
