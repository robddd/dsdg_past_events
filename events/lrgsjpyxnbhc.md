### Predict Customer Revenue - Kaggle Competition
25 October 2018

Want to figure out how to utilise the 80/20 rule and focus on your most valueable customers? Get working on predicting customer revenue with the recent Kaggle competition: Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
