### Earthquake Damage Prediction
19 December 2019

It's our final meetup of the year and our final chance to meet before the deadline of the Earthquake competition: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/page/136/ . This competition has proved to be an interesting one for all who have attempted it.

With the top of the leaderboard being dominated of our members, this is the place to be if you want to join in on discussion of the bleeding edge of feature engineering and creative ways to build models.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to work on the competition beforehand and then come to the group to share what you did and to ask questions about things you were unsure about.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
