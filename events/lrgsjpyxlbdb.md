After some strong first attempts at this competition we going to return to discuss the 'Home Credit Default Risk' once more: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data)

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end.

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:30 - Discuss and decide on Next topic
7:35 - Meeting ends
