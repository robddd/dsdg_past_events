As data scientists, we've all had a difficult time not getting stuck into the numbers of this current pandemic. This meetup we will run our usual discussion format with the topic of applying data science to any of the data coming out around COVID-19. You can share any visualisations, modelling or predictions that you have made, as well as ask questions around how to model this type of data / event.

We will be meeting up over Zoom, so if you haven't already, please install it beforehand. The link will be shared no later than the morning of the event.
