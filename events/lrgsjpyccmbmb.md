Thanks to everyone who joined the call last week. It was an interesting discussion. We are going to continue with the [https://www.kaggle.com/c/optiver-realized-volatility-prediction/](https://www.kaggle.com/c/optiver-realized-volatility-prediction/) competition. For those yet to start, there were several recommendations for using this notebook [https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/introduction-to-financial-concepts-and-data](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/introduction-to-financial-concepts-and-data) as a way of getting familiar with the competition.

We also suggest checking out these papers which are complementary to the competition:
� Feature-based time-series analysis - [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08055.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08055.pdf)
� Time Series FeatuRe Extraction with tfresh [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231218304843](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231218304843) with Python library - [https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh)

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition and/or take a look at the papers before coming to the meetup. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you tried, ask questions and to learn.

If you would like to propose a research paper, blog post, Kaggle competition or something else as the topic for the following meeting, prepare a 30-60 second proposal. We will have these proposals at the end of the session.

We hope to see you there!
