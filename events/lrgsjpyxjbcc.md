This week we are trying something a little different. You are invited to come along to Auckland Data Science Discussion Group's first hands on session. Bring your laptop and get your hands dirty.

We will work together and help each other with Machine Learning and Kaggle problems. if you are new to Kaggle and are having trouble making a submission this is your opportunity to get past that road block. If you are more experienced this could be your chance to get help to get rid of that vanishing gradient problem that has been keeping you up late at night.

If you cannot make it please remove yourself from the RSVP as soon as you can.

We have the space from 6pm - 745pm, show up between 6 and 6:30. Hope to see you there!
