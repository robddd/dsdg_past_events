"The features you use influence more than everything else the result. No algorithm alone, to my knowledge, can supplement the information gain given by correct feature engineering." - Luca Massaron (Kaggle master)

This week we are discussing a paper on feature selection:

Please try to read the paper before the meetup. It is fine if you do not understand all of it. The purpose of this meetup is for questions and discussion and to help each other learn. Some of the topics may be quite advanced in this meetup but we encourage members of all levels to attend.

We at the GridAKL cafe space for this meetup. Thanks to GridAKL for hosting us!
