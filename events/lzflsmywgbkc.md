### Data Science & Machine Learning Discussion Group
27 April 2017

For this meeting we will be discussing cross-validation:

The meeting will start with an informal whiteboard presentation on cross-validation by Tony. Tony is very experienced with machine learning with a very high rating on kaggle and a lot of industry experience with machine learning projects.

We encourage you to do some reading on cross-validation and some thinking about any questions you have on the topic. After Tony has presented we continue discussing cross validation and you will have the opportunity to ask questions about it.

Please update your RSVP status if you are not going to be able to attend.

Meeting will be held at Level 4 of JSA https://www.google.com/maps/place/220+Queen+St,+Auckland,+1010,+New+Zealand/@-36.849349,174.7649052,19z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x6d0d47fb2816dc39:0xa2e08463de73ab88!8m2!3d-36.8493458!4d174.7654121?hl=en
