### 27 January 2022
RSVPs: 31 | Waiting: 0 | Event Type: physical | [Meetup Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/282650625)

The Data Science Discussion Group welcomes you back for 2022. We will be kicking off the year with a reading group for this paper: "Learning from learning machines: a new generation of AI technology to meet the needs of science" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13786)

The paper looks at the differences between using AI for industry and using AI for science. And looks at how AI models could be adapted to transform scientific discovery.

We encourage you to read the paper before the session. It is fine if you do not understand all of it, or finish it. The purpose of this meetup is to ask questions and to learn.

If you would like to propose a research paper, blog post, Kaggle competition or something else as the topic for the following meeting, prepare a 30-60 second proposal. We will have these proposals at the end of the session.

We hope to see you there!
