Data Science Discussion Group - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

[https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

This week we are returning to the house price regression problem, where we will be discussing our latest attempts. We will go around the room, sharing our best score and the techniques which we used, If you were unable to get to the point of making the submission you can share about where you got stuck or ask any questions that came up for you.

We strongly encourage that you give the competition a good go in the time leading up to the discussion so that we can learn through our experience in the competition:

Meeting Schedule:

6:30 - Meeting / Discussion begins

This week the discussion will take place in AUT city campus:

WT building (2 - 14 Wakefield Street) and can be accessed through swipe cards. I will have to let all attendees in from the WT reception area. The main entrance gate of the building on Wakefield Street will lock shortly after 6:30pm so you may not be able to get in if you are late.
