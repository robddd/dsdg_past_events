## Stacking Methods and Flu Competition
### 30 July 2020
RSVPs: 20 | Waiting: 0 | Event Type: physical | [Meetup Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/271550920)

Last week the flu competition gave us plenty to talk about, and we didn't get sick of it. One of the topics which repeatedly came up was the multi labelling and the potential for "Stacking" models. This week we will look into stacking as well as continue with the flu competition https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/

Stacking is a very nuanced topic, so we have put together a few options to look at:
- Original Wolpert Paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222467943_Stacked_Generalization
- Issues in Stacked Generalization: https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5466
- Ensemble methods: bagging, boosting and stacking: https://towardsdatascience.com/ensemble-methods-bagging-boosting-and-stacking-c9214a10a205
- Kaggle Forum Post: https://www.kaggle.com/general/18793

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition (Or attempt to read some of the stacking related material) before coming to the meetup. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you tried, ask questions and to learn.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end
