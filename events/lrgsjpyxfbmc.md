### 29 March 2018
RSVPs: 50 | Waiting: 2 | Event Type: physical | [Meetup Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/246203237)

This week we are switching gears and will be discussing a seminal paper in the domain of image classification entitled 'ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks'

[https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)

While this topic can get very technical, this paper is regarded as one of the easier ones to read in this domain.

Please try to read the paper before the meetup. Do not worry if you don't understand all of it. This meetup is for the purpose of discussing the paper and asking questions about the things that we are unsure about.

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue

6:30 - Introductions

6:35 - Discussion - ImageNet Classification

7:30 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
