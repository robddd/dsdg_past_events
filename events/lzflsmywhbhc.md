This week we are returning to the house price regression problem, where we will be discussing our latest attempts. We will go around the room, sharing our best score and the techniques which we used, If you were unable to get to the point of making the submission you can share about where you got stuck or ask any questions that came up for you.

The function of this meeting is to provide an opportunity to get together after having made attempts at this competition so that we can discuss and ask questions related to the competition.
