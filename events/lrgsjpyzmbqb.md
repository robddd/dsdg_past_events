### 12 September 2019
RSVPs: 51 | Waiting: 0 | Event Type: physical | [Meetup Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/263117387)

With our members taking interest in 2 competitions at the moment we will at this meeting, each have a chance to discuss one, the other or (for the complete diehards) both of these competitions:

- 'Richter's Predictor: Modelling Earthquake Damage' competition: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/page/136/
- Kaggle IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection

If you are new to machine learning and want to try one we would recommend the Earthquake Competition as it is more of a straightforward dataset.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission, or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end
