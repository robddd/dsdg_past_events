### Decoding Speech in the Paralysed
29 July 2021

This week we look at cutting edge research where an electrode array was placed over the brain and by having a paralysed person try to say the words, language was generated. Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning were amongst the technologies used.

The materials we will look at are here - both published within the last few days:
� New York Times article https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/health/speech-brain-implant-computer.html
� New England Journal of Medicine article https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/health/speech-brain-implant-computer.html this article is available for free by registering an account. The registration process is fast and straightforward.

As always we encourage you to read the material before coming to the meetup. It is fine if you cant understand parts of the it or cannot finish it. The purpose of this meetup is to spend some time with the material beforehand so that you can comment about what you thought and ask questions around where you got stuck. We are all here to learn.

If you would like to propose a research paper, blog post, Kaggle competition or something else as the topic for the following meeting, prepare a 30-60 second proposal. We will have these proposals at the end of the session.

We hope to see you there!
