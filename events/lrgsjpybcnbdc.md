### Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction
22 October 2020

We are back at Grid with our first in-person meetup in a while!

This week we are looking at the Kaggle competition: Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa Similar to the "Flu" competition we have been looking at, this competition has multiple labels to predict, so allows us to continue looked into stacking models.

We recommend getting started with this great introduction to the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/184005

Looking for ideas or inspiration? Here is a great post with links for novel ideas of how to approach this problem https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/183377

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leader-board. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
