IMPORTANT NOTE: This week we will NOT be meeting in person. The meeting will be on Zoom, those who RSVP will get a link sent out to them.

Last week we had a very interesting discussion around this competition. This was much different from the topics we usually talk about which are around trying to get an extra 0.1 or 0.2% accuracy. Instead looking at a new problem which is very far from solved, as of writing, the highest score on the leaderboard is less that 10%.

This week we are returning to the Kaggle - Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge (ARC): [https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/overview](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge/overview) A good place to start is by looking at the data here and working out how you solve the puzzles yourself: [https://www.kaggle.com/tayyabali55/explored-the-complete-abstraction-data-train-test](https://www.kaggle.com/tayyabali55/explored-the-complete-abstraction-data-train-test)

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end
