### Recurrent Neural Networks Discussion
28 February 2019

After a succession of meetups where we looked at the Elo competition, this week we going to look at some blogs and a video on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RNNs are used to get state of the art results in NLP as well as sequence processing.

- Introduction to RNNs - https://medium.com/explore-artificial-intelligence/an-introduction-to-recurrent-neural-networks-72c97bf0912
- The Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNNs http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
- Andrew Ng's intro videos to his sequence learning course.RNN W1L01 : Why Sequence Models - The first 3 videos give a good intro and it gets more in depth from there

As always we encourage you to look at the material before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you do not understand it all. The purpose of this meetup to learn and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
