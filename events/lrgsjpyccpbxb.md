### Implementing Deep Learning with Tabular Data
2 December 2021

Last week we looked at this great survey paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01889v1 for Deep Learning with Tabular data.

This session we are asking people to try and implement one or two of the approaches from the paper, or maybe finding a Deep Learning for tabular data library and getting it to run on a tabular dataset.

We are encouraging everyone to spend a few hours getting their hands dirty so that they can come along and share their hard fought for learnings. And ask for help where they got stuck

Some examples of things to try include:

� https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04247.pdf
� https://pypi.org/project/deepctr/

If you are looking for a tabular dataset to try, this could be an option: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-nov-2021/data

If you would like to propose a research paper, blog post, Kaggle competition or something else as the topic for the following meeting, prepare a 30-60 second proposal. We will have these proposals at the end of the session.

A Zoom link will be sent out around an hour before the meeting starts.

We hope to see you online!
