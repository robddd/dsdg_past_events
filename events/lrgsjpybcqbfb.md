How do you know how well your model will perform on real world data? How do you know if one model has a real performance edge over another? These questions may seem simple enough, but as you go deeper often you find yourself with more questions than answers. This paper attempts to help navigate these murky waters and will be the main focus of this meetup: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12808.pdf

With a decent amount of interest in the MOA competition and it closing 2 days before this meetup. We will also spend some time covering this competition. It is up to you if you would like to look beforehand at the paper, the competition or both.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition AND/OR read the paper before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you cant understand parts of the paper or don't get a high score on the leader-board. The purpose of this meetup is to spend sometime with the materials so you can talk about what you did and ask questions around where you got stuck.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end
