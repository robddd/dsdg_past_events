### Embeddings for Categorical Variables
7 June 2018

This week we are back at GridAKL and will be discussing a relatively new technique of creating embeddings for categorical variables. This technique allows you to take advantage of the power of deep learning with categorical data and has been used to win recent Kaggle competitions.

Before the meetup you may want to look at this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06737.pdf

or if you prefer an easier read these articles:
- https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-structured-data-8d6a278f3088
- http://www.fast.ai/2018/04/29/categorical-embeddings/
- https://towardsdatascience.com/using-word2vec-for-better-embeddings-of-categorical-features-de75020e1233

And if you would like to apply these methods you could use this Kaggle competition: Avito Demand Prediction Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction

As always we encourage you to look at the material before the meetup. It is fine if you do not understand all of it. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about the material and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end.

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
