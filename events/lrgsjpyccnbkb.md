How important is the data?
� Does it not really matter since you can use fill in the blank state of the art model and all of your problems will be solved?
� Does it matter more than ever since everyone has access to state of the art models and having the best dataset is what will get you the best performance?
� Or is it more nuanced?

This is the question we will explore in this week's Data Science Discussion Group.

We suggest before the session that you watch this video by Andrew Ng "A Chat with Andrew on MLOps: From Model-centric to Data-centric AI" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo

We encourage you to watch the video beforehand so that we can discuss it in the session. It is fine if you don�t understand all of it. The purpose of this meetup is to ask questions and to learn.

If you would like to propose a research paper, blog post, Kaggle competition or something else as the topic for the following meeting, prepare a 30-60 second proposal. We will have these proposals at the end of the session.

We hope to see you there!
