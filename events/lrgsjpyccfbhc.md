This week we are taking a break from our usual discussion format and are hosting a presentation by Alan Radford: "Introduction to Simulation Competitions on Kaggle"

Alan is one of the strongest Kaggle competitors of the group, with several high placing results. And tonight he will be using the Rock Paper Scissors Competition [https://www.kaggle.com/c/rock-paper-scissors/overview](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rock-paper-scissors/overview) which he placed in the top 5% in to introduce us to simulation competitions. He will also introduce us to the Hungry Geese competition.

There will be an abundance of insightful and practical information in this presentation. Donï¿½t miss out!
