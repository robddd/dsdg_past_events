### Deep Learning with Tabular Data
4 November 2021

Every year Deep Learning displays superiority for more and more tasks. Making predictions with tabular data is one task where other techniques are still holding their ground, but it is close. This week we are looking at this survey paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01889v1 to get a feel for the current state of the art Deep Learning methods for Tabular Data.

As always we encourage you to read the material before coming to the meetup. It is fine if you don't understand parts of it, the purpose of the meetup is to ask questions and to learn.

If you would like to propose a research paper, blog post, Kaggle competition or something else as the topic for the following meeting, prepare a 30-60 second proposal. We will have these proposals at the end of the session.

A Zoom link will be sent out around an hour before the meeting starts.

We hope to see you there!
