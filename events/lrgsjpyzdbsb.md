### Elo Merchant Category Recommendation - Kaggle competition
14 February 2019

Last week we had some really interesting and in depth discussion on this competition, so we decided that we will keep working on the Elo Merchant Category Recommendation Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation
This competition presents some great opportunities to try to deeply understand the problem and add your own creativity.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not manage to make a submission or get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Also, during the meetup, feel free to discuss anything around the fast ai ML course that some people are working through: https://course18.fast.ai/ml

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends
