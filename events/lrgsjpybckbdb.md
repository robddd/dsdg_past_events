### TabNet: Deep Learning for Tabular Data
2 July 2020

We have spent many sessions looking at tabular datasets and the best methods to build models for them. Up until now, boosted trees have been dominating these types of tasks. But, times are changing, Neural methods have been steadily closing the gap to the point where the results are looking very similar.

For this reading group, we will look at one implementation, the TabNet. Below are links to the paper and some implementations:
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07442
- GitHub (Google Research): https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/tabnet
- Github - PyTorch Implementation: https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet

Please try to read the material before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you do not understand it all, the purpose of the meetup is to learn and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end

Meeting Schedule:

6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:25 - Discuss and decide on next topic
7:30 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
