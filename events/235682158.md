## Discussion of Kaggle Competition: Digit Recogniser
### 1 December 2016
RSVPs: 12 | Waiting: 8 | Event Type: physical | [Meetup Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/235682158)

First meeting of Data Science Discussion Auckland

This meeting will involve a brief introduction of members and the group, followed by a discussion of the Kaggle competion "Digit Recognizer" [https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) .

The idea is to spend a bit of time between now and the meeting looking at the competition and possibly attempting tutorials or our own solution. So that when we meet we can discuss our experiences with the competition.

Schedule

6:00 - 6:30 arrive between 6 and 6:30 for informal discussion

6:30 meeting starts, introduction of group and discussion of the competition

7:30 we decide topic of next meeting

7:45 meeting ends

A note: Meeting size may be limited for this first and possibly 2nd meeting. I am sorry if you miss out this time but I am working towards finding a suitable location which can fit more people. Also please only RSVP if you are going to come to the meetup so that those who want to come along can.

Thanks.
