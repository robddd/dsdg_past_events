RSVPs: 32 | Waiting: 0 | Event Type: physical | [Meetup Event Link](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Discussion-Auckland/events/253507135)

With home 'Home Credit Default Risk' competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data closing on this day, we will come back for a final wrap up.

Alternatively, we are giving you the chance to come and ask any Data Science question that you may have. This is your chance to ask that question you've been wondering about for weeks. And hopefully there will be someone there who can answer it.

As always we encourage you all to attempt the competition before coming to the meet up. It is fine if you attempt the competition but do not get a high score on the leaderboard. The purpose of this meetup is to talk about what you did and to ask questions.

Have a think about any research papers or Kaggle competitions you would like to discuss in future meetups. We will spend a few minutes on this at the end.

Meeting Schedule:

6:00 - 6:30 - Arrive at venue
6:30 - Introductions
6:35 - Discussion
7:30 - Discuss and decide on Next topic
7:35 - Meeting ends

A big 'Thank you' to GridAKL for providing the venue!
