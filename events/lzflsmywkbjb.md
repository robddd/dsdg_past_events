Data Science Discussion Group - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

This week we are returning to the house price regression problem, where we will be discussing our latest attempts. We will go around the room, sharing our best score and the techniques which we used, If you were unable to get to the point of making the submission you can ask questions about where you got stuck. The purpose of this meetup is for questions and discussion and to help each other learn. Some of the topics may be quite advanced in this meetup but we encourage members of all levels to attend.

Meeting Schedule:

6:30 - Meeting / Discussion begins

7:30 - Discussion on what to talk about at next meeting

7:40 - Meeting ends

We are at the GridAKL cafe space for this meetup. Thanks to GridAKL for hosting us!
